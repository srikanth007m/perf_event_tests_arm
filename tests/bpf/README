Needed 4.9-rc kernel, plus debugfs mounted
sudo /home/vince/research/linux-kernel/linux-git/tools/perf/perf record -v -v -v -a -e bpf-output/no-inherit,name=evt/ -e ./test_bpf_output.c/map:channel.event=evt/ ls /


Need libelf-dev and libdwarf-dev installed before perf will compile
with BPF support.  Otherwise you get obnoxious
	BPF support is not compiled
message

/home/vince/research/linux-kernel/linux-2.6/tools/perf/perf 
record -a -e bpf-output/no-inherit/ 
-e ./test_bpf_output.c/maps:channel:event=evt/ ls /

run as root

still get
	Failed to load program for unknown reason



Generating BPF files is a pain.

They are architecture specific and have to be re-built each time
you re-build the kernel.

Also you need a version of the clang compiler to build them.

The sample code in this directory is from a lkml posting

You will need CLANG 3.7 or newer.  You can get nightly snapshots for
	Debian from http://llvm.org/apt/
