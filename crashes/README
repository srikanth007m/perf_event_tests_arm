These tests can crash your system!  You have been warned!

They have been included to aid in testing whether a current
running kernel has been properly patched.

Included tests


+ pe_inherit_memleak

  This tests the bug with inherit support that can quickly 
  out-of-memory your system with unfreeable kernel memory.

  This problem was introduced in 2.6.34 and fixed in 2.6.39
  It has been backported to various stable kernels (2.6.38.2, etc.)
 
    changeset 38b435b16c36b0d863efcf3f07b34a6fac9873fd
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=38b435b16c36b0d863efcf3f07b34a6fac9873fd

+ pe_task_schedule_panic

  This tests the bug with task context scheduling that can
  cause a kernel panic or system hang.

  This problem was fixed in 2.6.39 and has been backported
  to the various stable kernels (2.6.38.4, etc.)

     changeset ab711fe08297de1485fff0a366e6db8828cafd6a
     http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=ab711fe08297de1485fff0a366e6db8828cafd6a


+ oflo_sw_cpu_clock_crash 

  Error with overflows and perf::perf_count_sw_cpu_clock and probably
  any software event.

  This test will either become unkillable, or else hard lock your system
  (maybe with a WARN_ON error) on Linux 2.6.32 - 3.0.0

  It was fixed in 3.1, a8b0ca17b80e92faab46ee7179ba9e99ccb61233
  and is gradually making its way into the stable trees.

+ sw_event_config_overflow

  Panic caused by setting attr.config too high on software events,
  and it wasn't caught due to a 32/64-bit check?
 
  Introduced in commit b0a873ebb ("perf: Register PMU implementations").
 
  Patch that fixes is:                                                
  [PATCH] perf: treat attr.config as u64 in perf_swevent_init()       
  vulnerable through 3.9                                              

  Fixed in 8176cced706b5e5d15887584150764894e94e02f

Potential tests.  These were reported to the kernel list as causing
issues but I was unable to reproduce a crash.

+ offcore_response_mask

  Prior to Linux 3.9 the offcore response registers were not properly
  masked on SNB and IVB.  This could potentially cause a GPF but
  I have not been able to cause one with a 3.8 kernel.

  Fixed in f1923820c447e986a9da0fc6bf60c1dccdf0408e

Panics I have no test for

+ perf,x86: fix kernel crash with PEBS/BTS after suspend/resume
  
  Fixed in 1d9d8639c063caf6efc2447f5f26aa637f844ff6

  The test involves suspending/resuming while perf is being used,
  and there's not a good way to automate such a test.
