<center><h1><tt>perf_event</tt> kernel panics and crashes</h1></center>

This page has some info on some kernel bugs related to the
perf_event subsystem that can cause userspace programs (such
as those using PAPI) to crash the system.
<br><br>

Sample code that shows some of these issues can be found in
the <a href="validation.html">perf_event testsuite</a>.

<h2>Fixed in 3.13</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>perf ftrace function tracer permission lockup</b>

	<br><br>
	
	Fixed by 12ae030d54ef250706da5642fc7697cc60ad0df7

	<br><br>

	CVE-2013-2930

	<br><br>

	Found by trinity and perf_fuzzer, it is trivially easy
	for a plain user to lock the kernel due to an improper
	check for root permissions in the ftrace code.

	<br><br>


<li><b>Alpha bug found by perf_fuzzer</b>
	
	<br><br>

	Fixed in: 6e22f8f2e8d81dca

</ul>

<h2>Fixed in 3.11</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>ARM and ARM64 oops due to over-running config</b>

	<br><br>

	Fixed by d9f966357b14e356 

	<br><br>

	Introduced with Linux 3.2 with 8a16b34e2119

	<br><br>

<li><b>CVE 2013-4254: ARM and ARM64 oops in validate event</b>

	<br><br>

	This bug is potentially a local root exploit, but as far
	as I can tell there was an extremely narrow window of time
	where it was easy to exploit (from 3.11-rc1 through 3.11-rc6)

	<br><br>

	Fixed by c95eb3184ea1a3a25

	<br><br>

	Introduced  with Linux 3.2 with 8a16b34e2119

	<br><br>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Fixed in 3.10</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>mmap_close bug.</b>

	<br><br>

	Denial of service.

	<br><br>

	Found by perf_fuzzer, it happens if you
	do some complicated event setup involving mmap buffers
	and then exiting.

	<br><br>

	Introduced sometime between 3.0 and 3.2?

	<br><br>

	Fixed in 3.10, commit 9bb5d40cd93c9dd4be74834b1dcb1ba03629716b
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Fixed in 3.9</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>CVE-2013-2094 : Software Event u64/u32 Problem</b>

	<br><br>

	Local root exploit.

	<br><br>

	Found by trinity, this panic is 
	caused by setting attr.config too high for software events,
	and it wasn't caught due to a 32/64-bit check?

	<br><br> 

	Introduced in commit b0a873ebb ("perf: Register PMU implementations").

	<br><br>

	Patch that fixes is:                                                
	[PATCH] perf: treat attr.config as u64 in perf_swevent_init()       
	vulnerable through 3.9                                              

	<br><br>

	Fixed in 8176cced706b5e5d15887584150764894e94e02f

	<br><br>

<li><b>offcore_response_mask</b>

	<br><br>

	Denial of service

	<br><br>

	On Sandybrige and Ivybridge the offcore events were not properly
	masked to avoid setting reserved bits.
	This could potentially cause a GPF but
	I have not been able to cause one with a 3.8 kernel.

	<br><br>

	Fixed in f1923820c447e986a9da0fc6bf60c1dccdf0408e

	<br><br>

<li><b>perf,x86: fix kernel crash with PEBS/BTS after suspend/resume</b>

	<br><br>

	Denial of service

	<br><br>

	Fixed in 1d9d8639c063caf6efc2447f5f26aa637f844ff6

	<br><br>
  
	The test involves suspending/resuming while perf is being used,
 	and there's not a good way to automate such a test.

	<br><br>

<h2>Fixed in 3.5</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>CGROUP reference counting problem</b><br><br>

	Fixed by changeset: 9c5da09d266ca9b3

</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Fixed in 3.2</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>SLUB problem</b>

	<br><br>

	Linux 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 hard lock or panic when under high perf_event
	load if SLUB is enabled rather than SLAB.  See full details in
	this thread: <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/12/16/463">
	perf_event hard locks in 3.1.5</a>.  Still no resolution; git-bisect
	was inconclusive.

	<br><br>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Fixed in 3.1</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>CVE 2011-2918: Software Event Overflow Bug</b>

	<br><br>

	Denial of service.

	<br><br>

	An error with overflows and perf::perf_count_sw_cpu_clock (and probably
	any software event) will cause your test to either become unkillable, 
	or else hard lock your system.  Sometimes generates a
	WARN_ON first.  Affects Linux 2.6.32 - 3.0.0.

	<br><br>

	<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/22/183">Linux-kernel thread where
	I report this issue</a>.

	a8b0ca17b80e92faab46ee7179ba9e99ccb61233</a>
	and will be in 3.1.
	<br><br>

	Also backported to some stable releases, 462fee3af72df0de7b60b96c525ffe8baf4db0f0.

<h2>Fixed in 2.6.39</h2>

<li><b>CVE-2011-4611 : perf, powerpc</b>

	<br><br>

	Denial of service.

	<br><br>

	Fixed in 0837e3242c7

	<br><br>

<li><b>CVE-2011-2521 : perf, x86: fix Intel fixed counters base initialization</b>

	<br><br>

	Denial of service.
  
	<br><br>

	Introduced by 41bf498, fixed by fc66c5210ec2

	<br><br>

<li><b>Inherit Bug</b>

	<br><br>

	Denial of service

	<br><br>

	With this bug you could quickly out-of-memory your system if your
	program enabled the "inherit" option, counted at least two events,
	and spawned threads.  

	<br><br>

	<br><br>

<li><b>Task Context Scheduling Bug</b>

	<br><br>

	Denial of service

	<br><br>

	This bug is most noticable when using multiple threads.
	The perfsuite "make -s check" test failure is what made me notice it.
	Symptoms were hard system lockup.

	<br><br>

	Fixed by changeset
